# Models for ROSS-Legacy

These models originally shipped with [ROSS](http://github.com/carothersc/ROSS).
Use the models in the [legacy]() branch with the [ROSS-Legacy version](https://github.com/carothersc/ROSS/releases/tag/Legacy).

Or, use any of the models in the master branch with regular ROSS.
